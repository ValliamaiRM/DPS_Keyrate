# DPS_Keyrate
This repository contains the code to recreate the plots in the work "Explicit attacks on Differential Phase Shifted Quantum Key Distribtion (DPS QKD).
This uses various packages including numpy >= 1.19.5, picos >= 2.2.55, and cvxopt >= 1.2.5.
Notebook SDP_MED_Cloning  solves the SDP corresponding to MED and Cloning of the 3-pulse DPS QKD states.
The plots generated in the DPS_SecureKeyRate notebook are for finding the secure key rate vs distance aginst two particular attacks - the minimum error discrimination and the cloning attack on DPS QKD.
